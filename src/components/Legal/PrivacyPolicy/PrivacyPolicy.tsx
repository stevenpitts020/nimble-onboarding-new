          <p>
            We use Google reCAPTCHA, a free service provided by Google, Inc., to
            protect NimbleFi from spam and abuse. Google reCAPTCHA uses advanced
            risk analysis techniques to decipher humans and bots. Google
            reCAPTCHA works differently depending on what version is deployed.
            For example, you may be asked to check a box indicating that you are
            not a robot or Google reCAPTCHA may detect abusive traffic without
            user interaction. Google reCAPTCHA works by transmitting certain
            types of information to Google, such as the referrer URL, IP
            address, visitor behavior, operating system information, browser and
            length of the visit, cookies, and mouse movements. Your use of
            Google reCAPTCHA is subject to Google’s{" "}

          <h3 id="title3-1-3">“Do Not Track” Signals</h3>
          <p>
            Some internet browsers incorporate a “Do Not Track” feature that
            signals to websites you visit that you do not want to have your
            online activity tracked. Given that there is not a uniform way that
            browsers communicate the “Do Not Track” signal, NimbleFi does not
            currently interpret, respond to or alter its practices when it
            receives “Do Not Track” signals.
